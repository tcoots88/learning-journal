# Choosing a Text Editor

A text editor is:
> A piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through a web
browser, that allows you to write and manage text, expecially the text that you write to build a web site

Additionally, there are a number of different text editors that are available.  Some basic text editors are pre-installed on most operating
systems, but are bare bones and lack many of the add-ons available in downloadble alternatives. The different types of text editors are 
important because some can help with things such as code completion and syntax highlighting.  

Some popular text editors can be found

Cheat Sheet

- **absolute** - Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
- **relative** - Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
- **~**  - **Tilde** - This is a shortcut for your home directory. 
- **.**  - **Dot** - This is a reference to your current directory.
- **..**  - **DotDot** - This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. 
- **pwd** - **Print Working Directory** -  It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
- **ls** - **list** - List the contents of a directory.
