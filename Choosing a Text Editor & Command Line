# Choosing a Text Editor

A text editor is:
> A piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through a web
browser, that allows you to write and manage text, expecially the text that you write to build a web site

Additionally, there are a number of different text editors that are available.  Some basic text editors are pre-installed on most operating
systems, but are bare bones and lack many of the add-ons available in downloadble alternatives. The different types of text editors are 
important because some can help with things such as code completion and syntax highlighting.

# What's a File?

>Everything from a text file, a directory, or even a keyboard or monitor is a file.  When working with Linux, there are some important concepts to keep in mind:
1. Everything is a file under Linux, even directories
2. Linux is an extensionless system, files can have any extension they like or none at all 
3. Linux is Case sensitive, look out for tiny, minute mistakes
