# Choosing a Text Editor

## What is a Text Editor
A text editor is:
>A piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through a web
>browser, that allows you to write and manage text, expecially the text that you write to build a web site

Additionally, there are a number of different text editors that are available.  Some basic text editors are pre-installed on most operating
systems, but are bare bones and lack many of the add-ons available in downloadble alternatives. The different types of text editors are 
important because some can help with things such as code completion and syntax highlighting.
