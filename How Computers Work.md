# What Makes a Computer, a Computer
## Four Components of a Computer
    1. Input
        - Anything you do to send information into the computer
        - Input devices include:
            - Keyboard
            - Mouse
            - Microphone
            - Camera
            - Touchscreen
            - Smart devices
    2. Storage
        - The computer takes all of the information from the input and stores it in memory
    3. Processing
        A computer's processor takes that information from memory and manipulates or changes it using an algorithm, or a series of commands, and then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again. 
        - This continues until the information is ready to be output
    4. Output
        - The computer can output the information in various ways such as:
            1. Text
            2. Photos
            3. Videos
            4. Games
            5. VR
            6. Signals to control a Robot
    - When connected to the internet, the output of one computer could be the input of another, and vice versa
# Binary and Data
    - The binary number system
        - made up of two 
          numbers, 1 and 0
    - Each digit is muliplied by two, instead of the normal 10
    - For example, the number 9 is represented as 1 0 0 1
     - `(1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1)`
     - With 8 wires (each wire is one digit), the number can go up to 255
    - Binary is the backbone to how all computers input, store, process, and output information
# Circuits and Logic
    -Circuits: millions of tiny components
    - Complicated Circuits:
        - Take multiple signals and combine the to give different results
    - Logic Gates
        - AND, NAND, NOT, NOR, OR, XOR
    - Why are smaller circuits faster?
        - the smaller the circuit is, the shorter the distance the electrical signal has to go.
