# Structure web pages with HTML

## Process and Design
### Who is the Target Audience?
1. Individuals: What are their demographics and how often are they accessing the page?
2. Companies: How big is the company, What are the positions of those accessing the page, what kind of budget are we working with, etc?

### Why Should People Access Your Site?
- Pinpoint the key goals and motivations of the visitors

### What Key Information Do Your Visitors Need?
 - What do they need in order to achieve their goals?

### How Often Will They Access the Site?
- How often are the same people accessing your site?
- How often is information being updated?

### Site Maps
 - Create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site
 - Card Sorting
    - A process that can be used to decide what information should go on each page

### Wireframes
 - A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the  hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require

### Getting Your Message Across Using Design
 - The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

 ### Visual Hierarchy
 - Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
- Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being
displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first

### Grouping and Similarity
- When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend.
    - Proximity
    - Closure
    - Continuance
    - White Space
    - Color
    - Borders

#### To Summarize
 - It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

## HTML5 Layout
### `<header> and <footer>`
 - The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
 -  A header or footer for an
individual `<article>` or
`<section>` within the page.
### `<nav>`
 - The `<nav>` element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
 ### `<article>`
 - The `<article>` element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
 ### `<aside>`
 - The `<aside>` element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an `<article>`
element or not.
### `<section>`
- The `<section>` element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
### `<hgroup>`
- The purpose of the `<hgroup>`
element is to group together a
set of one or more `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
### `<figure>` `<figcaption>`
-   `<figure>` can be used to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images).
-  The `<figure>` element should
also contain a `<figcaption>`
element which provides a text
decription for the content of
the `<figure>` element. In
this example, you can see a
`<figure>` has been added inside
the `<article>` element.
### `<div>`
- The `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
