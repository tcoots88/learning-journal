# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
## HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER
### Before diving into the JavaScript language, you need to know how it will  fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages.
- Each of these languages fit together in order to complete one finished product, the web page. 
    - HTML forms the content layer and gives the page structure and adds semantics
    - CSS forms the presentation layer and ehances the HTML by stating how it should be presented
    - JavaScript forms the Behavior layer and tells the page how to behave and adds interactivity
## How to use Objects and Methods
- `document.write('Good afternoon!');`
    - "document" - the **object** that represents the entire web page
    - "." - the **member oberator**, you can access the members of an object by using a dot between the object name and the member you want to access
    - "write ()" - the **write ()** method of the **document** allows new content to be written where the **`<script>`** element sits
    - "'Good afternoon!'" - Each piece of information is called a **parameter** of the method.  In this case, the **write ()** method needs to know what to write into the page
