## What is Version Control?
>Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. 

A popular Version Control System (VCS) is called Git.

## So What is Git?
>Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — 
Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored 
identical version of it.
