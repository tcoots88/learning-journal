# The ABCs of Programming
#### What is a script and how do I create one?
    - A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
    - Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
    Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
    - To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
#### Expressions
    - An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
#### Operators
    - Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
#### Arithmetic Operators
| Name      | Operator | Purpose & Notes     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Addition      | +       | Adds one value to another   |
| Subtraction   | -        | Subtracts one value from another      |
| Division      | / | Divides two values     |
| Multiplication        |    *   |          Multiplies two values using an asterisk |
| Increment      | ++       | Adds one to the current number   |
| Decrement   | --        | Subtracts one from the current number      |
| Modulus      | % | Divides two values and returns the remainder     |

#### String Operator
    - There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
    - Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation.
#### What is a Function?
    - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
- When you ask a function to perform a task it is knows as **calling** the function
- Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**
- When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, it is known as the **return value**
